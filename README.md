  Notes: 
    
 I have a decent understanding building an API contextually, but would benefit off a few quick questions to verify some things. While I didn't utilize much of the mySQL database, I did create it via CLI and manipulate it via python script in the backend for practice over the weekend. I felt pretty comfortable building the Docker container as well, this project has got me pretty comfortable with that as well.
